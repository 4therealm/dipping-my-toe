## Description
The Agency's website was functional, but not accessible.  
By refactoring the code to meet accessibility standards, the website is now optimized for search engines and more user friendly.

## Tasks
-Semantic refactoring  
-Element restructuring  
-Adding alt image attributes  
-Correct heading sequence  
-Creating title element  
-Link functionality  
-CSS consolidation  


## What I Learned 
-Just because the code works, doesn't mean its the best version  

-Using semantics enhances the ability of screen readers to interpret the content for the user. While also reducing the number of id's and class's needed to accomplish the task.  

-The order in which problems are approached is paramount. Originally I planned to fix the code by task. Once I got my bearings I began to feel only fixing one tag in a section of code without addressing the other tasks related to that code is inefficient and avoidable repetitive. I found that refactoring one element at a time, including the Styles and comments felt smoother and provided insight for addressing the next element.   

## Future Improvements
-The banner could also show company goals/values, success stories, and positive reviews  
-Include a team members section with pictures and brief bios with work experience  
-I think there is more that can be done visually when interacting with the navigation links
